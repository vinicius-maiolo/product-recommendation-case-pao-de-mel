**General Definitions of The Project:**

| **What**  | Support the Marketing team of the fictitious e-commerce *P√£o de Mel* in **understanding customer purchase** **behavior** and **providing relevant product recommendations**.|
| --- | --- |
| **Why**  | This will help optimize campaign strategies and improve both profitability and user experience. |
| **Who** | Data Analytics Engineering Team + Support from Sales/Marketing Team |
| **How**  | Discovering patterns through EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Building a Recommendation Data Model based on Apriori Algorythm.  |

### **Executive Summary ‚Äì Key Findings (results)**

### **Sales Performance & Customer Behavior**

- **Snacks lead sales**, with 866k units sold ‚Äî the top-selling department.
- **Snacks, Beverages, Frozen Products, and Pantry** combined account for **55% of total sales**.
- **Monday and Tuesday concentrate 35%** of weekly sales ‚Äî with volumes **40% above the average** of other days.
- **82% of purchases happen between 8 AM and 6 PM**, highlighting prime store hours.
- **Alcohol sales peak on Thursdays and Fridays (35%)**, a distinct pattern compared to other categories.

### **Product Affinity & Cross-Sell Opportunities (Apriori Algorithm)**

- **Sparkling Water** shoppers often buy multiple flavors ‚Äî up to **32% chance** of a second flavor purchase. *‚Üí Suggested action: Multi-buy promotions.*
- **Bean buyers** show a **20% affinity** with garbanzo beans and hummus. *‚Üí Suggested action: Legume bundle offers.*
- **Lean Ground Beef** and **Boneless Chicken Breasts** are often bought together (**30% confidence**) ‚Äî likely by fitness-focused customers. *‚Üí Suggested action: ‚ÄúHigh Protein‚Äù combos.*
- Strong link between **Zero Calorie Soda** and **healthy snacks**:
    - **52%** also buy **Fruit & Nut Bars**
    - **37%** of **Trail Mix** buyers also purchase soda

# Project Step-by-Step - **CRISP-DM** Methodology

---

- ## üß† 1. Business Understanding
    - **1st Phase ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis**
        - What is the sales distribution by:
            - Product department
            - Day of the week
            - Time of day
        - What are the Top 5 most sold products by department?
        - Are there time-based consumption patterns? (e.g. pizza in the evening, coffee in the morning)
    - **2nd Phase ‚Äì Product Recommendation**
        - Can we identify frequently co-purchased items using Association Rules?
        - Can we generate a product-level recommendation table with confidence scores and department data?
    - **Success Criteria for both phases:**
        - Usability and clarity of final data product for the Marketing team
        - Key insights from the exploratory data analysis

  **Analytical Environment:**
        
  Due to the large size of the sales dataset (over 5 million rows), we will use **Google BigQuery** as our cloud-based data warehouse for storage and analytics.
        
    - **Data Stack:**
        
      - **Google BigQuery (GCP):** data processing and storage
      - **SQL:** querying and data manipulation
      - **Excel:** final delivery format for product recommendations + data validation analysis
      - **Python + Jupyter:** for data exploration + additional analysis
      - **KNIME:** for implementation of association rules (Apriori Algorithm)

- ## üîß 3. Data Pipeline Infrastructure (ETL)
    
    ### üîÑ ETL Steps
    
    1. **Extract**
        - Source: Local CSV files provided by the business team
        - Transfer: Files will be manually uploaded directly into BigQuery
    2. **Transform**
        - **Raw Layer:** Ingestion of raw files into BigQuery (`raw_sales` dataset) with no changes to structure
        - **Curated Layer:** Data type normalization, field renaming for clarity, and semantic alignment (e.g. `order_dow` ‚Üí `day_of_week`)
        - **Warehouse Layer (`ft_sales`):** Denormalized fact table combining key fields for downstream analysis and model development
    3. **Load**
        - All intermediate and final datasets are stored in **BigQuery** for high-performance querying.
        - Final outputs (e.g. recommendation table) will be exported to Excel and Knime for business delivery.

    | Layer | Dataset/Table Example | Purpose |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Raw Layer | `raw_sales.sales` | Original structure from source |
    | Curated Layer | `curated_sales.products` | Cleaned, renamed, type-cast data |
    | Data Warehouse | `dw_pao_de_mel.ft_sales` | Denormalized for final analysis/model input |

    ### üîß Tools Used
    
    - **Google BigQuery:** Cloud data warehouse for storage and transformation
    - **SQL:** Transformation logic (manual scripts)
